        During my summer 2019 vacation to Hong Kong and Macau. I had the
        opportunity to Bungy Jump from the world's highest commercial point. At
        the time, whoever jumped from Macau Tower was inducted into the Guinness
        Book of World Records.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was standing at the top of the Macau Tower, prepared to leap 233
        meters straight down. It's so terrifying up there that people near me
        wet their pants, yet it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that everyone
        who can afford it should take advantage of. The whole operation takes
        less than two minutes, but those two minutes are enough to make you
        forget about everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I had the chance to do it all over again, I would definitely do it.
