        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Siddharth Gulati, but you may call me Sid if you
          prefer.<br />I'm from India, and I graduated with a bachelor's degree
          in engineering in July 2020.<br />At NCR Corporation, I worked as an
          App Dev Analyst. During my time there, I worked on front end web
          technologies and UI/UX design.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my school and college days I was very involved in dramatics and
          took part in various local stage shows and street plays.<br />
          I also do community work and was part of the Each One Teach One drive
          and part of the National Service Scheme(NSS).
