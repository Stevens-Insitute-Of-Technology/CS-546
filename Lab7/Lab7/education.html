        <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology(Present)</h2>
        <p>
          So far, my favorite class is CS-546: Web Programming 1. As the
          professor say's "This is not a class. This is like an internship."
          Even though I had prior web programming experience, the way I learned
          the concepts was never in a systematic manner, which made me hesitant
          to take on new work. However, even halfway through, I have gained so
          much information that I feel confident in choosing this profession as
          a career option.

          Eventhough I just started this semester my most memorable memory thus
          far is of orientation day. It was a very happy time for me because I
          had finally made it there after going through the application
          procedure and delaying my education for a year. It was also great to
          meet my peers in person after Covid-19, so it was a fantastic
          experience.

        <h2>The NorthCap University(2016-2020)</h2>
        <p>
          Introduction to Software Engineering was my favorite class during my time at NorthCap University. Despite the fact that it was an introductory course, that semester was the first time everything I had learned up to that point made sense. Before taking this class, I had no idea how much effort goes into creating software, and I used to just carelessly criticize the UI and functionality. Although the course was not totally technical, I learned about the psychology of software engineering.

          The time I organized a flash mob at The NorthCap University is my most vivid recollection of my time there. This concept was not widespread in the area where I used to reside, but it was something I wanted to be a part of, and I'm glad I did.
